# RestComm USSD Gateway
Enables web developers to build server side interactive messaging apps for mobile phones over SS7 infrastructure.

## Introduction 

USSD stands for Unstructured Supplementary Service Data what is a capability of GSM mobile phone much like the Short Message Service (SMS)

USSD information is sent from mobile handset directly to an application platform handling service. USSD establishes a real time session between mobile handsets and the application handling a service. The concept of real time session is very useful for constructing an interactive menu driven application.

RestComm USSD Gateway is built on [RestComm SS7](https://github.com/RestComm/jss7) and RestComm JSLEE Server. It offers RESTful HTTP interface that allows web developers to build interactive apps for feature mobile phones.
